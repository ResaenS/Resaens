CARIBBEAN LITERATURE IN TRANSITION
ANNOTATED BIBLIOGRAPHY


Caribbean Literature in Transition, 1970–2020. (2021). In R. Cummings & A. Donnell (Eds.), Caribbean Literature in Transition, 1970–2020 (Caribbean Literature in Transition, p. I). Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.

“The period from the 1970s to the present  produced a very rich and diverse  Caribbean literature that is widely recognized. Transitional Caribbean Literature  1970 - 2020 traces the region's contemporary literature across  established genres of prose, poetry, fiction and drama into new areas of creative nonfiction, recollections and speculative fiction. In particular, it focuses on challenging the narrow norms of Anglo-Saxon male writers. It is Caribbean literature from the late 20th century to the early 21st century (innovations in the form and style of literature) which changed  the  role and position of writers, and also our understanding of literature and the political terrain of its place. This also shows how modern Caribbean literature has focused  on social  complexity and continuous alienation in a continuous interest in identity, attribution and freedom.”

Dalleo, R., & Forbes, C. (2021). Introduction. In R. Dalleo & C. Forbes (Eds.), Caribbean Literature in Transition, 1920–1970 (Caribbean Literature in Transition, pp. 1-18). Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. doi:10.1017/9781108850087.001

“When the 1920s started, the field called 'Caribbean writing' was basically unheard of. 
Inside years and years, authors from the Caribbean were accomplishing overall 
acknowledgment, and an enormous group of grant, analysis, and hypothesis discussing 
the nature and forms of the writing had arisen. This volume recounts the narrative of the 
fast climb from the separated abstract endeavors of the nineteenth and mid 20th 
hundreds of years portrayed in Volume 1, towards the broad and quickly changing 
contemporary field found in Volume 3. Our attention is on the anglophone Caribbean, 
which we carry into discussion with abstract and political improvements in the 
francophone and hispanophone Caribbean. Since the sociopolitical as well as the 
abstract narratives of these social orders cross at various places, featuring such unions 
gives a more full picture of anglophone Caribbean scholarly examinations. Associations 
with the Dutch-speaking Caribbean still need to be composed, the aftereffect of still 
tenacious partitions in the district's scholarly practices.”

	“This volume inspects what Caribbean writing resembled before 1920 by studying the 
print culture of the period. The accentuation is on story, including a gigantic scope of 
classes, in shifting settings, and in various dialects of the Caribbean. Papers look at less 
popular writers and composing recently underestimated as nonliterary: famous writing in 
papers and flyers; fiction and verse like sentiments, nostalgic books, and numbers; 
non-tip top diaries and letters, like the accounts of the oppressed or the average 
workers, particularly ladies. Numerous commitments are near, multilingual, and 
territorial. Some surmise the social presence of inferior gatherings inside the texts of the 
predominant classes. Practically every one of the sections move effectively between 
time-frames, connecting texts, scholars, and abstract developments in manners that 
grow conventional ideas of artistic impact and group arrangement. Utilizing artistic, 
social, and authentic investigations, this book gives a total reconsideration of early 
Caribbean writing.”
