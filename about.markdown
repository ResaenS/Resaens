My name is Resaen Reaiah Caalah Stoute and I am 18 years old. I am currently a first year student at the Dominica State college  where I am majoring in economics and hospitality. In addition to this, I  work in my mothers shop and I also own a business. I attended the Convent High School where I studied geography, literature and business along with the other mandatory subjects. My most impressive achievements so far are scoring a grade 1 in both my english and business csec exams and graduating high school. In life, I would like to be an economist, hotelier and entrepreneur. I am a hardworking, determined, responsible and innovative person. I strive to do my best at any given situation no matter what drawbacks I may face.
