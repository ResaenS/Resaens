Progress report

Today I continued working on the spreadsheets. I did a good amount of work which I am very satisfied with. I finished a good amount of rows during my afternoon to morning period and at night time I did some touching up on some errors. This included making all entries the same and being consistent. I also had to remove the different states and enter just the United States. Whilst working I also edited some other columns as I went through.
