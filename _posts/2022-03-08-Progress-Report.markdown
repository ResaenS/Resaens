Progress Report

This week I continued working on the publisher column and finding information was easy. I  used different methods to quicken my pace. I would try to leave no blank spaces when I inserted information. I also highlighted the finalized columns in blue so I would not get mixed up. I worked on the spreadsheet during breaks and at night time. I also used urls to speed up  the process. I also started brainstorming for my individual project. I have an idea of what I would like to do however I do not know if I will be able to execute it in the way that  I  want to.
