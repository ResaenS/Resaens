This week was very hectic seeing that my other lectures kept pushing work and assigning assignments etc. I got  very little work done seeing that I kept trying to meet deadlines and the work never felt like it was finishing. I managed my time by working on the spreadsheet when my lectures canceled class or  whenever I had a break. I tried to get at least an hour in everyday. Sometimes I would not be able to but I made up for it when I could. Additionally I also found new articles and information for my individual project. In order to perfectly execute everything, i made three goals and separated each so that i can complete each fully to put my project together.
