Progress
After numerous challenges and hindrances I finally completed the columns which I was working on. Because of this, I was able to now focus on my individual project. I started putting my information together. With my three goals, I decided that it would be best if I fully completed each and then put the project together. I did all my research and grouped each accordingly. I then began working towards the final execution and will continue doing so for the next few weeks.
