The first article I read for week 2 was “what we think we build,” by William G Thomas. It was stated that what we think we build and what we build are oftentimes different. This offers both opportunities and challenges. One of these challenges was that digital history still can’t confront numerous document types. Additionally, seeing that there are numerous document types individuals may want to archive this acts as an opportunity to reconsider the digital archive.  I also learnt that digital humanities projects are collaborative and there are numerous activities in scholarly practice. Mr. Thomas also stated that digital humanities is basically humanities in the digital age and there are three qualities:
Increased scale of data and research involved.
Addressing the global distribution of discourse and materials. 
Using new modes of production.

Trevor Owens – Please write it down
Digital humanities projects must contain writing and if there is no writing there is no project. After every project, an individual should write down what they have learned so that they can reflect on what their goal was, what was the outcome and what was learned.

Miriam Posner – How did they make that
Paige Morgan – What do digital humanists do
In this blog, Miriam Posner explained some Digital humanities projects along with the tools and technologies used. She highlighted tools such as omeka, JavaScripts, CityEngine and Scalar all which I know nothing about. However,  I am interested in learning how to utilize these tools. 
In the article What do digital humanities do, Miss Morgan defined numerous terms in Miss Posner’s blog. An explanation of what each is used for and how its involvement was given.
Some of theses terms included:
Knowledge sites
Databases
Geographic mapping sites
Digital 3D models
Crowdsourcing project
All these terms were new to me therefore I have got newfound knowledge which will help me in the future.
