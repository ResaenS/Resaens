In the past weeks, everyone has been working on the spreadsheet. I was given the publisher column. I worked my way from the top to the bottom and tried to get in as many hours as I could. At first this was very slow and frustrating seeing that for some books deeper research had to be done. But as time went by, I got the hang of it and was entering as many as a 100 publishers a day. I did this throughout the day whenever I had breaks and also at night if I had little school work to do.
