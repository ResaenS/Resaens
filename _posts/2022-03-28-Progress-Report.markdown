Progress Report
Currently I am working on the Author Country Column. I have also been sick for a while so I really canâ€™t do work. However I worked on finding all the information for books with only one author. Slowly but surely I got done and then it was time to do the books with multiple authors. This part was not very satisfying to me at first, However I found a way to collect the information which was both quick and organized. I would first find the authors to put the information in the  country 1 and country 2 column. I would then copy the rest and paste it on a document and put it in a list form. I would then find the country for each and then copy and paste it into the comment. Some challenges I faced were sometimes I would accidently resolve the comment and lose what I entered and slow internet.
