Main Topic- Visualizing caribbean literature
Individual Topic - Development and insight into the publication of Caribbean literature.

OVERVIEW
Caribbean literature is the literature of the various territories of the Caribbean region. Authors present their work through the themes of innocence, exile and return to the motherland, resistance and endurance, engagement and alienation, self-determination and domination. With reference to alexanderstreet.com, Caribbean Literature provides a powerful new tool for postcolonial studies.The purpose of my project is to analyze the development of Caribbean literature publications, investigate how its marketing has developed and lastly present the journey of a few authors.To complete this research project, I will find answers through data analysis. I plan to present my findings mostly in the form of text, video and audio. I will do so by using arcgis which is a storytelling tool. I choose this tool seeing that ICT is not my strong point and this software is easy to navigate through. Secondly, I want my audience to be engaged therefore using this will allow them to both learn something new and be interactive. 
I chose this topic because without knowing the history about something there will never be a true understanding nor will individuals realize the value of this. Seeing that most of my audience will be caribbeans, this will allow them to see how our ancestors and past helped to shape us.  Also, this is important seeing that it will provide a great amount of individuals with newfound knowledge which they can share. This topic caught my interest because I like to read therefore doing this will allow me to have a glimpse into an author's journey into making and publishing books, what inspired them etc. Next, there is also the fact that I do not know too much about Caribbean literature so this will also give me a sense of accomplishment in the end. 

GOALS
*To examine the development of publishing Caribbean literature.
*To investigate the development in the marketing Caribbean literature.
*To outline the author's journey into making and publishing books.
