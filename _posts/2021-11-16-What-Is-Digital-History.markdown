Douglas Seefeldt and William G Thomas, III, “What is digital history?” 	

Digital history is defined as an approach to examine and represent how the  past works with the improvements in communication technologies of computers, internet networks, softwares and systems. Digital history not only digitizes the past but also creates a system where people can experience major historical events. One example of a  digitization project from the article was the Library of Congress’ American Memory project. This project was very informative and had numerous other articles within it for further explanations. In the second article, the writer discusses how wikipedia can benefit students. Most times, as students we are told not to use wikipedia seeing that the information may not be accurate. However, this individual states that 
Wikipedia allows students to undertake scholarly research, read unmediated texts, and write for a real-life audience. By creating wikipedia pages, students learned how to do literary research or improve their skills and it also helped them to become experts on understudied topics.
