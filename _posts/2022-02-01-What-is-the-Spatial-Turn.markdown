Readings: Jo Guldi, What is the Spatial Turn?
          Jo Guldi, The Spatial Turn in Literature

Before I began the reading I knew that most if not everything would be new to me.The first term I was introduced to was Spatial turns. This refers to academic disciplines oftentimes referring to Gis and the neogeography revolution. (Neogeography is the use of geographical techniques and tools for personal and community activities. )By scraping spatial data from archives, researchers can now address bigger problems. Additionally,  Cartographic projects about land were used to help researchers. With the spatial turn, individuals are expected to use these new tools to answer past questions. 
The spatial turn in literature - From  my reading, I understand that the spatial turn can be linked with numerous things. With literature a great amount of research has to be done. Furthermore by using these tools to gather, analyze and present literature. Literary historians embraced the "imaginal" as a device for mining close perusing. Investigations of the "green world" in Shakespeare, of Blake's nonexistent urban communities, of the changing vistas of nineteenth-century explorers, and of the experience of rail line and retail chain. This was inspired by highly imaginative forms of historical landscape description.
