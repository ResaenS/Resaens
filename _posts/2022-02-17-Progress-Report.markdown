Progress Report
This week was very hard in terms of managing my time. However, I did what needed to be completed and then focused on the spreadsheet and my hours. I was assigned to the Research Team therefore my task was solely completing the spreadsheet.  I started by trying to edit the columns which were already completed by my peers. I filled in missing information, fixed spelling errors etc. I then went on to compl;ete the publisher column which I had not finished. This time, I went both ways from the bottom to the top and the top to the bottom. To me, I found this way motivating seeing that I knew I would meet in the middle. I also found what I wanted to do for my project. Therefore in my free time I would do research to see if there was anything that I wanted to add or change.
