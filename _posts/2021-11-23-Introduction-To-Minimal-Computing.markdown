Minimal Computing is computing done under some set of significant constraints of hardware, software, education, network capacity, power, or other factors. Minimal computing includes both the maintenance, refurbishing, and use of machines to do DH work out of necessity. From my reading, I learned that minimal computing groups provide a space for discussions and resources relating to the impact of minimal computing. They do this theoretically and practically. Questions such as  what, how and why are often asked in order to collect the information. 
The User, the Learner and the Machines We Make
As stated in the first article, questions such as  what, how and why are often asked when approaching minimal computing. However, the writer stated that he prefers to base minimal computing around the question “What do we need?”. “This means that my minimal computing does not stand in as a universal call, but rather as a space for new questions and practices, an injunction to constantly repeat the question, “what do we need?”
